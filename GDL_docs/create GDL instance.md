# Create new instance of GDL platform

## Overall workflow:
- Set up new instance on Wordpress.com (Done by project lead) or re-use existing
- Deploy current version of the GDL code to site
- Import H5P and resources metadata from production site
- Always import English
- French, Danish and Vietnamese currently have translated topic text - needed to test that specific feature
- Import configuration for Badges
- Change success and fail URL for all level up tasks (should explore if it is possible to script this)
