The COVID-19 outbreak has created a situation that poses a colossal threat, now and in the future, to children and their families. A grim reality especially compounded among children already affected by poverty, disability or social exclusion. Experts predict that, given high contagion risks and the time needed to distribute a vaccine, COVID-19 is poised to be a long-term global health and welfare crisis.

The global school shutdowns and health crisis exacerbate already challenging realities for lower-income countries: with the limited or non-existent access to learning resources in underserved languages, their current education, as well as future opportunities and welfare, are significantly set back. According to the UN, [100 million more children fail basic reading skills because of COVID-19.](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1088392)

## Educational resources as digital public goods

This situation proves how critical it is to accelerate the development of open educational resources and make them available in relevant languages for children and their communities.

Too often, scarce public and international development resources are spent investing in new software code, tools, data collection, content and innovations for sector-specific solutions that are locked away behind licensing fees, with data only used by and available to specific initiatives.

With our open approach to digital development we aim to help increase collaboration in the digital development community and avoid duplicating work that has already been done. Programs can maximize their resources — and ultimately their impact — through open standards, open data, open source technologies and open innovation. By taking advantage of existing investments when you are able, you can apply finite digital development resources toward creating global goods.

Norad refers to the Digital Public Goods Alliance and the [DPGA Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) as definitions of digital public goods. Both resources and future GDL platforms must be compliant with the DPGA standard.

GDL is a platform that aims to support other platforms and projects. It is a clearly defined goal that the content on GDL should be available on other relevant platforms as well as on the GDL. An open and platform agnostic design is therefore central to the project&#39;s architecture and methodology.
